## 2026-05-12 — Routine aborted: strategy not approved
- **Pattern:** 01-pre-market routine triggered while `memory/strategy.md` still has `version: 0` and `approved: false`.
- **Lesson:** Trading-related routines must short-circuit at Step 1 when strategy is unapproved. No research, no broker calls, no orders — only log the abort. Robin must run `00-strategy-init` and manually approve `strategy.md` before any cron routine can do real work.
- **Encoded as rule?** Yes (already in `CLAUDE.md` Strategy Lifecycle and routine Step 1).

## 2026-05-12 — Git workflow: sync with main before AND after every routine
- **Pattern:** Cloud routines clone fresh; Robin may edit memory files (e.g. approve `strategy.md`) on `main` between routines. Without an explicit sync, the working branch falls behind and the routine acts on stale state (this morning: working branch still saw `approved: false` after Robin had already merged the approval to `main`).
- **Lesson:** Every routine starts with `git fetch && git merge origin/main --no-edit` into the working branch, and ends by **opening or refreshing a PR with auto-merge enabled** (NOT direct push to main, since main is branch-protected and direct pushes return HTTP 403). Any merge conflict in memory files = abort + notify, never auto-resolve.
- **Encoded as rule?** Yes (added to `CLAUDE.md` Memory Protocol Step 0; mirrored in `routines/01-pre-market.md` Step 0 + Step 6). PR-based flow uses GitHub MCP (`create_pull_request` + `enable_pr_auto_merge`).

## 2026-05-12 — Strategy mandates 50% VOO but guardrail #1 caps single position at 35%
- **Pattern:** First real pre-market draft: `strategy.md` (Variant C) specifies 50% VOO core, while `CLAUDE.md` Hard Guardrail #1 caps any single position at 35%. Conflict detected before any orders placed.
- **Lesson:** When `strategy.md` conflicts with a Hard Guardrail in `CLAUDE.md`, the Hard Guardrail wins (non-negotiable). The routine must cap to the guardrail, park the residual cash, flag to Robin, and request explicit resolution (revise guardrail vs. revise strategy vs. split core across multiple ETFs). Never silently exceed a guardrail; never silently skip the strategy.
- **Encoded as rule?** Yes — Robin chose to extend Guardrail #1 with an ETF-Core exception (broad-market index ETFs designated as Core may go up to 60%; individual stocks still 35%). Encoded in `CLAUDE.md` 2026-05-12.

## 2026-05-12 — Alpaca rejects fractional trailing-stop orders
- **Pattern:** Tranche 1 BUYs used `notional` (dollar amount) → Alpaca fills produce fractional share quantities (e.g. 24.7329 VOO, 5.7096 MSFT). Sending the full fractional `qty` as a trailing-stop order with `time_in_force=gtc` returns HTTP `{"code":42210000,"message":"fractional orders must be DAY orders"}`. Trailing stops require GTC to actually trail across days, and fractional orders force DAY — the two are mutually incompatible at Alpaca.
- **Lesson:** Either (a) submit BUYs by integer `qty` rather than `notional` so fills are whole-share, or (b) on fill, place the trailing stop on `floor(filled_qty)` shares (integer fallback) and cover the remaining fractional sliver with a regular fixed-price `stop` order at `avg_entry × 0.90` (Alpaca allows fractional `stop` orders as DAY, but for true protection across nights this needs to be re-issued each day, or consolidated once tranches sum to ≥1 whole share). Today we took option (b) integer-only; ~1.5 sh / ~$300 notional left temporarily uncovered. Mitigation: address in 03-midday or after tranche 3 when fractional remainders consolidate to whole shares.
- **Encoded as rule?** Partially — recorded here; needs codification in routines (likely a helper in `src/brokers/` that abstracts "place trailing stop on a fractional position"). Open question: prefer integer-qty BUYs (cleaner stops, slight cash drift from target weight) vs. notional BUYs (exact weight, fractional stop gymnastics).
